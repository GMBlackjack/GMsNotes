    "Another paper on planetary formation. What makes this one special is that it considers the effectiveness regime of other similar studies, as well as doing a *LOT* of statistical analysis and plotting of the results. Also contains a model for planetary formation via pebble accretion and gas accretion, and it considers other effects as well. "
