    "\n",
    "This is a historical text compounding much of Herschel's astronomical observations, including nebulae, double stars, stellar magnitude, southern hemisphere observations, comets, the moons of staturn, and sunspots. The most relevant part to me is the naming of Saturhn's moons, but there's probably a ton of other stuff in here I haven't even touched. My goodness though there's a lot of tabulated raw data here... I suppose that is how it had to be before the Internet though.\n",
