    "The main reason to look at this paper is not for the Cirrus Clouds, but rather for the basic description of the correlated-k distribution method. It is however not as good as other sources at describing it; but it DOES have good simplified toy graphs that are easier to examine than the overly-detailed realistic ones. \n",

    "This paper gives some in-depth examples of the Correlated-k Distribution Method and is a good source of graphs, and it also discusses multiple atmospheric constintuents. It also talks about applications of the method and some results from it. A good place for exmaple graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is probably the best Correlated-k Distribution Method paper. While it doesn't have the simple toy models or the large number of graphical examples, what it does do is explain the math and reasoning behind the method excellently, as well as having a graphical description of what \"correlation\" even MEANS. More of the mathematical structure underlying the method is shown here.\n",

    "While this paper is about exoplanet modeling and the C/O ratio, that's really not what we use it for. We use it for its description of a complicated implemenation of the Correlated-k Method. It gives some hints as to how the Quassian Guadrature can be applied, most importantly. "
