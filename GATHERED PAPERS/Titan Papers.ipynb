    "This paper is primarily concerned with the description of an updated radiative transfer model for Titan's atmosphere, including new data and some better procedures. It compares the results of its previous model with the new model for the Huygens Landing Site. Of special note is the discovery of the non-integer Fractal Dimension of the aerosols; previous work had used 2, but this work finds that results work best with 2.3 or 2.4 Fractal Dimension. (Quick explanation: fractal dimension is how much an object's \"measure\" scales with doubling. Squares when doubled go like $x^2$, with a fractal dimension of 2, while cubes go like $x^3$, thus 3. The aerosol surface area is thus structured enough, or \"rough\" enough, to scale faster than a simple 2D model would imply). There is a lot of discussion on how to remove seams in VIMS images due to viewing geometry differences, and the model is also applied to Selk Crater and surrounding areas, including the Dragonfly Landing Site. This paper is a bit too crammed full of stuff, in my opinion, and could have been split up. Regardless, the ultimate goal of the model was to extract surface albedo and assign labels to different terrain types, which it appears to have succeeded at. \n",

But we do know where it's currently going thanks to this paper and a nice map with a ton of arrows! The flow is west to east. (Or left to right. Read maps carefully just because a longitude is labeled E doesn't mean it's pointing east, unfortunately... directions are fun). This paper concludes a few things. One, that topography is not the primary dictator of dune flow direction, at least not at global scale--rather the mechanism is likely wind/air based. The arrows imply that the dunes don't actually sink at the equator, but move outward toward the 35 degree latitude lines, the central \"belt\" is an unstable equilibrium. Yes, there are few if any dunes up there at 35 degrees, hence the fun. The answer isn't really clear as to why this is, but the paper suggests the dominant theory is that the dune material is up there it's just changed form. Secondary theory: the dunes are young and have not yet finished their migration to the sink. \n",

(Did they even know it was a problem or did they assume it was obvious?) Anyway the solution is that the sand is transported by storms or occasionally fast gusts. Examining the implicaitons, this means that Titan winds would in fact go east to west normally, until upsets occur. (Note: this is highly speculative and doesn't seem to be definite; compare with Huygens?) Also the terms \"eastward\" \"westward\" \"easterly\" and \"westerly\" are all used in this paper which is infurating. WestWARD is going TO the west. WesterLY is coming FROM the west. \n",

This paper is a formation model of Menrva with a specific focus on it potentially allowing for biotic processes, maybe even cracking the crust and reaching the subsurface ocean. It's hard to transport material from the subsurface ocean to the surface, but this is certainly one way to do it. This paper contains topographic information, ISS data, VIMS data, radar data, a simulation of formation, and theorization. The ironic result is that, in contrast to giant impacts on Earth, Menrva crater actually greatly improves the environment on Titan for life. The breach/melt of the ice crust happens in most simulations. Another funny result: even though the impact is so huge and the crater obvious, the topography is still very level, so much so that the simulation doesn't really show the final crater on the final state, even though we know it's there. Minimal topography everyone! (Personal note: life improvement happens even if the inner ocean isn't reached at the impact just creates a water lake, which it most certainly did).\n",

    "So. Um. Ontario Lacus is a bit odd for more reasons than just being the only south polar \"sea\" or \"major lake\" or whatever. See, it also has shoreline \"bathtub rings.\" This paper mainly goes on about how we can clearly see this stuff but haven't the foggiest idea what it is. Evaporite? Shelf? Beach? Floating stuff? *shrug.* There's also two distinct areas in the rings which is just even weirder. \n",

    "The \"river.\" More accurately just a canyon that is currently filled because the local sea level has risen (theoreitcally), \"flow\" here isn't really river-like. Vid Flumina is probably better described as a \"liquid-floored canyon\" than a river. It is huge though and obviously canyons *form* due to fluvial processes, so we've got some curiosities here. \n",

    "The only confirmed lakes of Titan are on the poles, but here we have evidence of *possible* lakes in mid-latitude regions. The actual identity is still shrouded in mystery, and this paper is part of the reason we need better radiative transfer models so we can determine if these are really lakes or not. Has locations of many potential candidates, and includes a discusison on Griffith et all 2012's equatorial candidate. This paper can't rule it out entirely but it does not think the equatorial candidate has the right properties.\n",

    "Probable evaporite locations. Helpful for comparing to probable evaporite locaitons. Also adresses the presence of \"granular lakes\" which are transitional between filled and empty, correlated to partially filled areas or just mudflats. This paper brags a little bit at how VIMS can identify more details about surface liquid than radar. There is a strong correlation between these lakebeds and the Regios. Mentions the Tue Regio absorption line. Paper concludes that these dry lakebeds are almost certainly evaporite, big discovery if confirmed. Limitation: no clue what it's made out of. As usual. \n",

    "Paleoseas (ancient seas that are no longer seas anymore) are still of importance for research. So let's dig in! Basically it identifies four large areas at the south pole that were likely filled with liquid in the deep past. (Admittedly it relies on the \"Saturn Orbit Configuraiton\" explanation to justify this making sense, which is  controversial). Only problem is that there is little to no evaporite in the four basins, though this may just be because the basins are so old the evaporite has been \"cleaned away\" though some mechanism or other. Yes one of the basins contains Ontario. The curious observaiton made is that these paleoseas have no sign of evaporite, but the Regios (equatorial and not really discussed here) DO and would have to be wetted more recently. Fascinating. "
