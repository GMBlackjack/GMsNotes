Be sure to explain the basics of Titan briefly, then also explain briefly what we are specifically simulating. Justify use of methane ocean and SRTC++.]"

If not, that will need to be described here.) Explain the free parameters and what we can adjust (wavelength and index of refraction mostly). Perhaps include a visual diagram of the \"experimental setup\" of Detectors around the Titan model. Discuss the atmosphere model and where it came from, make it clear that we do not factor in absorption at this time, but there isn't expected to be any in the methane windows anyway. May need to bring up the Lambertian simulation?]"

Regardless, show off the simluation's results; be sure to include discussion of all wavelengths, not just the three used in \"Jason Color.\" Point out some curious notes, including the \"eclipse view\", but also point out that the atmospheric knowledge that could be gained here is not the point of the paper. Draw connections between the results and hypotheses: one of the big ones is the limb brightening due to the index of refraction. Make it clear that the primary reflection is not shown. Explain the \"blueness\" of the images. End with the fact that while the simulations seem reasonable, they aren't going to be particularly useful unless we can validate them: cue next section.]"

Show a visual comparison first, then a quantitative comparison. (Structure: once per flyby used? Once per feature? Or do all visual comparisons and then all quantitative ones?) Compare the quantitative differences and assign some kind of confidence value as to how close our model is to reality. We HOPE that this validation is confirmed. If it is not we presumably need to go back to the drawing board and figure out what went wrong rather than publishing this paper. (if it goes wrong it's possibly a lack of absorption or some other feature.)]"

Most of the observations I currently know of are best put in Results as they are observations about the results directly rather than any real new knowledge. If validation flies, we do have one piece of knowledge: to find lakes look for fully illuminated disks and find the BLUE in Jason Color. Other possible dicsussion points: deviations from reality, noise at five microns, error quantifications if we can get them, other potential signs of lakes. Possibly bring up the Lambertian simulation here? That would require explaining why it is also blue, which should be done but may distract from the purpose of this paper.]"
