    "So, as we are not using an IDE (Integrated Development Environemnt) for most of our stuff, whenever we change something in a program we have to manually recompile it, or else if we run it again it'll be as if we have not made any changes. The primary way to do this is `gmake`, called as `gmake program`. If gmake is already set up for the program we are using, this is all we need to do as it will compile the program's changes and manage any dependencies. NOTE: you'll have to run this in the right folder (otherwise gmake may not be able to find what it's working with.) \n",

    "Now once a program is properly compiled, it'll need to be run. You could just type in the program's name and run it (folder dependencies may or may not matter, depending). However, in our cases we run a bunch of simulations so we'll want to be able to manage the piriority. We do this with the `nice` command. `nice +10 program` makes a program run with a very low priority, and `nice -10 program` would make the program have an extremely high priority. That said, uh, you probably don't have permission to do -10. You probably only need to use 'default' and '+10' in this situation, so you can still run programs while simulating in the background."

    "\n",
    "The first way to use it, and the simplest, is to take a Jcube that holds real data from a flyby of Titan. Just feed `titancolor2` it and it will create an image with RGB values taken from three specific wavelengths: 5.00, 2.01, and 1.27 microns respectively. (Smaller wavelengths are blue.) \n",
    "\n",
    "This is if you have complete, real data. But we often run simluations here that don't have real data and, perhaps more importantly, don't have every wavelength lined out. We usually run one wavelength at a time. What you do in this case is rely on another program: `JblocksZ`. Give `JblocksZ` three cubes with single wavelenths: it will treat the first as 1.27, the second as 2.01, and the third as 5.00. It will spit out a cube (named \"blocked\" by default) that `titancolor2` can read and give a color image. \n",
    "\n",
    "`titancolor2` can also just directly produce a black and white image for single cubes, even single wavelength ones, but this requires a new setting be run: `titancolor2 --style haze`, and then feed this the cube. This will produce a black and white image akin to `Jcubeviewer`, though things will be \"fuzzy\" as the sharp pixel edges are slightly smoothed in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`titancolor2` also has another modifier that can be added, `--multiplier`. You attach this at the end after specifying the file to act on, and then give it a number. 1 does nothing, larger numbers make the result dimmer, smaller numbers make it brighter. Why is it numbered like this? I dunno.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feed `titancolor2` multiple files (such as by using the `*` to select a large number of similar ones) it will spit out a result for each one. "
