Your chances of guessing right at any given time on waking up are always 50/50, that hasn't changed. But in all possibilities, you are asked the quesiton once on heads, and twice on tails. The thing is do you consider the time you spend to be a variable? In that case, you choose tails always since any given wake up you are more likely to be in a tails than a heads, especially if you do the experiment multiple times. But if you only care about an individual moment in isolation, you have 50/50 either way. There are arguments here and I'm not sure waht I buy."
