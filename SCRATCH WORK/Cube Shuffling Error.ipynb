    "The goal: make a program that takes in an array of 3D cubes and spits out another array of 3D cubes. The first array was organized by wavelength and had (incidence, emission, azimuth) as the points. The new array should be organized by azimuth and have (incidence, emission, wavelength) as the points. Simple, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the cubes are certainly shuffling and organazing their data, I can even access it in the cube objects themselves. However, after the program's done running, some of the created *files* do not have any values in them. But only some of them. Degrees 0 10 20 30 40 45 50 55 65 and 180 have their values, seemingly correctly. \n",

    "So, as best as I can tell, steps 1-4 go through flawlessly, because afterward I can pick individual values out of the `swap_wave_azimuth` vector of cubes at will and get a result. (There are *occasional* NANs but those were because the original data had some. Point 5,5,1, which I am testing above, never has NANs). So the data exists and since the files that *do* work have the right data, presumably it's in the right arrangement as well. \n",

    "I ran into a bit of a block when I couldn't figure out how to edit the actual writing code to prove it for problems: `Jio.c++` for instnace. I tracked down the actual writing step to `(*this)(x,y,z)`. But since the cube itself is the one calling the function to write (and the subfunctions it takes to get there)  it should easily be accessing its points. And while the function its using to write is paralellized, it's only paralellized when it's called, every individual cube we write should be able to act without being interfered. (And it's also deterministic, which angles are able to be saved as .Jcube files and which are not). So I am quite stumped. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is at least partially working, as the axes values for the wavelength are put in every time. It's like, for some reason, the write function is writing as though the values had never been put in, despite me being able to access them in the middle of the program with ease. What's up with that?"
