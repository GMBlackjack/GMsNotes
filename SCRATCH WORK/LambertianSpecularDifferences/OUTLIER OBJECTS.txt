OUTLIER OBJECTS:

Low density brown dwarfs/red dwarf stars: these are young objects still collapsing and cooling off, they will slowly approach the rest of the objects. 

Kepler 51 c and d: super-earths/sub-neptunes with abnormally large radii. They are examples of "super puff" planets. Some of the lowest known densities of any exoplanet!
