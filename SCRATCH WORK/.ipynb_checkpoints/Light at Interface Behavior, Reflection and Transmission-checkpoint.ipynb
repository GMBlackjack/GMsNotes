    "So, in my work we have a need to know the reflection coefficient at arbitrary angles on a boundary with a known index of refraction. The issue is, behavior at a boundary at an angle is known to vary with polarization, and we have randomly polarized stuff. So we need to figure out what exactly is going on.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now asin can only take values from -1 to 1, so if the fraction is too large it is undefined and we have no internal reflection. However, this would imply the air-water boundary never perfectly reflects, and yet we can see in images that it does. Hmmmmmm. This does imply that even at the extremes, we are not experiencing *total* reflection. There really is more to dig at here.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course we also know the law of reflection, incidence equals refleciton angle. None of this has anything to do with the *magnitude* though. To determine the magnitude we have to split up any light to paralell and perpendicular components. The boundary conditions are known for this situation (grabbed from Schwartz, but they could be from anywhere). \n",
