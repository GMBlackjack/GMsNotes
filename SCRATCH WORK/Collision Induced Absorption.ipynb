    "\n",
    "The gaseous particles in the atmosphere all have their own absorption spectra. In Titan, Methane is the primary abosrber, but there's also carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and otehr things, each of which absorb specific wavelengths and add together to form a total absorption spectra. This absorption primarily has to deal with quantized energy levels, and certain excited states being allowed/dissalowed for specific photon energies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many larger particles are often suspended in the atmosphere. On Earth this would be water a lot of the time, but on Titan it's primarily large hydrocarbons of relatively unconstrained composition. These larger suspended particles both scatter and absorb a wide variety of wavelengths. We don't have the capacity to build up the exact nature of the aerosols from theory, but we can use our observations to determine what their contribution is, and thus adapt it into the fold. We model the haze with relative densities, single scattering albedos, and the like: meaning both scattering effects and absorption is modeled. (Though the nature of the scattering direction has to be specified.) \n",

    "### Rayleigh Scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen is the dominant gas in the atmosphere of Earth and Titan, and in both it preferentially scatters higher frequency light in a specific and well-konwn way--Rayleigh Scattering! This makes the Earth's sky blue, and Titan's orange. Explanations for exactly why can be found later. It happens for any particles of a size much smaller than the radiation's wavelength. Visible light is measured in hundreds of nanometers, atoms themselves are measured in tenths of nanometers, so yeah that checks. This universality of the effect is what differentiates it from Gas Absorption.\n",
